# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
flutter:

# To add assets to your package, add an assets section, like this:
# assets:
#   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
#   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
#
# For details regarding assets in packages, see
# https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
#
# An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
# https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

# To add custom fonts to your package, add a fonts section here,
# in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
# "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
# list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
# example:
 fonts:
   - family: Almarai
     fonts:
       - asset: assets/fonts/Almarai/Almarai-Bold.ttf
       - weight: 700
       - asset: assets/fonts/Almarai/Almarai-Light.ttf
       - weight: 200
       - asset: assets/fonts/Almarai/Almarai-Regular.ttf
       - weight: 400
